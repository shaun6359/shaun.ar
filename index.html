        <div class="info-container">
            <div class="info-box left">
                <h3>Undergraduate Student</h3>
                <p>I am a second-year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto, pursuing 
                a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in 
                Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey is complemented by my 
                involvement in two dynamic clubs: the University of Toronto Finance 
                Association, where I explore my passion for finance, and UTFR, a 
                Formula racing design team that allows me to apply my engineering 
                skills in a hands-on environment. I have always placed a strong 
                emphasis on maintaining a top academic standing, believing that a 
                solid foundation is essential for achieving my goals. 
                Beyond my studies, I thrive on collaboration and innovation, 
                constantly seeking opportunities to grow and learn from others in 
                both academic and extracurricular settings.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-box right">
                <h3>Finance & ML Enthusiast</h3>
                <p>Although my major is in ECE, I have a strong passion for both finance and 
                    machine learning, and I aim to pursue a career in finance or fintech, 
                    where I can merge my technical expertise with financial analysis. This past 
                    summer, I conducted international research in Bangkok, Thailand, where I 
                    explored how Generative AI can capture major stock patterns. I developed and 
                    refined a TimeGAN model, evaluating its performance using an XGBoost 
                    classification model. This project, along with my broader interest in machine 
                    learning, further fueled my enthusiasm for leveraging AI to drive innovation 
                    in financial forecasting and decision-making.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-box left">
                <h3>Core Beliefs</h3>
                <p>I firmly believe that technology has the power to drive innovation and 
                    bring about meaningful, positive change in the world. My passion lies in 
                    finding creative ways to integrate AI into everyday life, making it a tool for 
                    enhancing well-being and solving real-world problems. For me, it’s not just 
                    about the work; I’m deeply family-oriented and always prioritize those 
                    closest to me. Balancing my personal and professional life, I strive for 
                    self-improvement every day, believing that growth—both as a person and as a 
                    professional—is essential for making a lasting impact. I’m driven by the 
                    idea that success 
                    comes not just from what we achieve, but how we inspire and uplift those 
                    around us.

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>When I'm not working on AI models or developing new projects, 
                    you'll likely find me in the gym or diving deep into my love for cars. 
                    I weight train 4-5 times a week and am proud to say I can bench 225 lbs—fitness
                    is a huge part of my life! I grew up swimming and practicing Taekwondo, where I earned my 2nd-degree black belt 
                    and won several medals in regional tournaments. My passion for cars, carried over from my dad, also 
                    inspired me to create my 
                    own mobile car detailing business, S&P Detailing. When I’m unwinding, R&B 
                    music is my go-to, with artists like PartyNextDoor, Tory Lanez, Bryson Tiller, 
                    and The Weeknd constantly on repeat.

                        <p> 
                            I developed an AI-driven diagnostic system leveraging ResNet-50 for the classification of pneumonia from X-ray scans, achieving over 80% accuracy 
                            on test data. This model not only provides accurate predictions but also generates automated, professional-grade medical reports to streamline 
                            diagnostic processes. To make this tool accessible to healthcare professionals, I built a full-stack web application using Flask, complete with
                             secure user authentication to safeguard patient data. The application enables users to upload X-ray images, receive real-time diagnostic feedback, 
                             and easily generate downloadable reports in PDF format. By integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I ensured an intuitive, responsive interface that 
                             delivers a seamless user experience from image upload to report generation, helping bring AI-driven insights into everyday medical workflows.</p>

                        <h3>Project Details</h3>
                        <p> I developed the Sentivest AI Trading Bot, an algorithmic trading system that 
                            makes automated decisions using Python, the Alpaca API, and 
                            sentiment analysis. I integrated the FinBERT machine learning model to 
                            assess the sentiment of news articles, driving buy and sell decisions with a 
                            remarkable 99.9% confidence threshold. To minimize risk and optimize returns, 
                            I designed bracket orders that included automatic take-profit and stop-loss 
                            settings. Additionally, I backtested the trading strategy using three years 
                            of historical data on the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) from Yahoo Finance, which 
                            demonstrated a consistent pattern of profitable trades.</p>

                            I implemented LSTM and bi-directional LSTM models, 
                            achieving 80% and 76% accuracy, respectively, which 
                            demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning and 
                            time series analysis. Additionally, I integrated the 
                            GPT-3.5 Medium API via Hugging Face to create an 
                            nteractive finance chatbot that delivers real-time,

                            that utilizes cosine similarity to measure the likeness 
                            between words and sentences. The core of the project 
                            involves constructing semantic descriptors from text 
                            files, capturing the contextual relationships between 
                            words based on their co-occurrence within sentences. 
                            By comparing vectors representing words, the model
